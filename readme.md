## Overview

![screenshot](images/screenshot.png)

This project is solution to the challenge to build {TITLE OF PAGE} at <a href="http://devchallenges.io" target="_blank">Devchallenges.io</a>. It is a responsive web page showcasing {FEATURE}. I have successfully completed this challange and deployed the web page successfully.

- You can view deployed page <a href="{LINK TO DEMO}">here</a>.

- This challange was better for improving skills for placing elements at different locations and working with multiple images. It was a wonderfull experience for me. I faced many challenges during this one challange but got a lot of experince from building it.

- From this challange, I have learned better positioning of the elemnts using css. I also leanred flex and grid layout somewhat and how to use them. I came to know that it is better to designed unit(smallest) elements first which improve the placement of other elements.

- Hit and trial is best when learning at a beginner level, after some time you will get the idea what is happening and gain better understanding for desingning a web page. Which will improve your overall skills and improve your pace of work. Keep building keep trying.
