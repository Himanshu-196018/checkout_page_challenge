## Overview

![screenshot](images/screenshot.png)

This project is solution to the challenge to build Checkout Page at <a href="http://devchallenges.io" target="_blank">Devchallenges.io</a>. It is a responsive web page showcasing Chekout form filled by buyers when shopping. I have successfully completed this challenge and deployed the web page successfully.

- You can view deployed page <a href="https://himanshu-196018.github.io/checkout_page_challenge/">here</a>.

- This challenge was better for improving skills for working with form elements. It was a wonderfull experience for me. I faced many challenges during this challenge but got a lot of experince from building it.

- From this challenge, I have learned better positioning of the elemnts using css. I also leanred flex and grid layout somewhat and how to use them. I came to know that it is better to designed unit(smallest) elements first which improve the placement of other elements.

- Hit and trial is best when learning at a beginner level, after some time you will get the idea what is happening and gain better understanding for desingning a web page. Which will improve your overall skills and improve your pace of work. Keep building keep trying.
